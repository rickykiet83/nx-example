# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `apps/` contains runnable apps. Current apps include `cart/` and `products/`.
- `apps/*-e2e/` contains Playwright end-to-end suites for each app.
- `libs/` contains shared and domain-specific libraries (`cart/`, `products/`, `shared/`).
- `dist/` is the default build output folder generated by Nx targets.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `yarn start` runs `nx serve` for the default project (`products`).
- `yarn build` builds a single project; `yarn build:all` builds `cart` and `products`.
- `yarn test` runs Jest unit tests for a project; use `npx nx test <project>` for a specific app/lib.
- `yarn e2e` runs Playwright end-to-end tests (projects in `apps/*-e2e`).
- `yarn lint` runs workspace and project linting; `yarn format:write` auto-formats with Prettier.
- `yarn dep-graph` opens the Nx dependency graph for impact analysis.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript/TSX is the primary language; styles are SCSS where applicable.
- Formatting is enforced by Prettier and linted by ESLint; prefer `yarn format:check` before commits.
- Follow Nx naming patterns: project folders in `apps/` and `libs/`, tests named `*.spec.ts`/`*.spec.tsx`.

## Testing Guidelines
- Unit tests use Jest and live alongside source (for example, `apps/cart/src/app/app.spec.tsx`).
- E2E tests use Playwright in `apps/*-e2e/src/*.spec.ts`.
- No explicit coverage threshold is defined; add tests for new behavior and regressions.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Recent commits use short, imperative messages (for example, “set title product dynamic”); keep the same tone.
- PRs should include a concise summary, the Nx commands you ran (for example, `yarn test cart`), and screenshots for UI changes.
- Link related issues or feature requests when applicable.

## Configuration Tips
- Use `npx nx <target> <project>` to run any target listed in a project’s `project.json` or `package.json`.
- Prefer `nx affected:*` commands when working on multiple apps/libs to limit scope.
